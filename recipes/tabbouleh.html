        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This zingy and refreshing salad dish is the perfect accompaniment to any meal this summer. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>½ cup bulgur wheat</li>
            <li>1 large tomato, diced</li>
            <li>1 small cucumber diced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
            <li>3 medium bunches curly parsley</li>
            <li>sea salt</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook bulgur wheat according to package instructions. Drain off any excess water, and set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Combine the diced cucumber and tomato in a medium bowl with ½ teaspoon of the salt. Stir, and let the mixture rest for at least 10 minutes, or until you’re ready to mix the salad.</li>
            <li>To prepare the parsley, cut off the thick stems. Then, finely chop the parsley and remaining stems.</li>
            <li>Add the cooled bulgur to the bowl of parsley.</li>
            <li>Strain off and discard the cucumber and tomato juice that has accumulated in the bottom of the bowl (this ensures that your tabbouleh isn’t too watery). Add the strained cucumber and tomato to the bowl..</li> 
            <li>In a small measuring cup or bowl, whisk together the olive oil, 3 tablespoons lemon juice, garlic, and remaining ½ teaspoon salt. Pour it into the salad and stir to combine. Taste, and adjust if necessary—add another tablespoon of lemon juice for zing, or salt for more overall flavor.</li>
            <li>If you have the time, let the salad rest for 15 minutes before serving to let the flavors mingle. Otherwise, you can serve it immediately.</li> 
        </ol>
